Denkyem means “crocodile.” It is a symbol of adaptability, cleverness, from the proverb, “Ɔdɛnkyɛm da nsuo mu nanso ɔhome mframa,” to wit, “The crocodile lives in water yet it breathes air.” One may attribute the adaptability of the reptile to himself to show his own adaptability and ingenuity coupled with formidability and mystery. The idea that it takes ingenuity to live in water but breathe air comes from the inability of humans to do that. Hence, the anthropomorphized crocodile becomes a symbol that embodies superhuman traits the user desires to communicate about himself.
