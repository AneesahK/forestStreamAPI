Gye Nyame is an Akan expression that literally means “Except God.” It expresses the omnipotence and supremacy of God in all affairs. Gye Nyame is arguably the most popular Adinkra symbol. It expresses the deep faith the Akans have in the Supreme Being, called by many names and titles including Onyame (Nyame), Onyankopɔn, Twereduampɔn (the reliable one), and many others. In the Akan scheme of things, God (Nyame) is omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient. Gye Nyame has become an icon of all Adinkra, encapsulating the faith of an African people who see God’s involvement in every aspect of human life. The expression “Gye Nyame” can be used in many ways. For example, it could signal the necessity of God’s intervention in a difficult situation which transcends the ability of man to resolve. It could also be used to show the relative greatness of a task or entity. For instance, by saying “Obiara ntumi nku me, gye Nyame,” (literally “Nobody can kill me except God”) the speaker signifies his hardiness as well as his faith in God to protect him from harm.
