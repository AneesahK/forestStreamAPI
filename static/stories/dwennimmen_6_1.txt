Dweninmmen means “the horns of a ram.” It represents strength (in mind, body, and soul), humility, wisdom, and learning. What is it about the horns of a ram? They are strong; they are fierce; they can be intimidating; they are a defense. Dweninmmen is a symbol of strength with humility. Sheep are humble and can be easily guided. They can be led to and away from food at the shepherd’s will, much unlike goats. Humility is a cherished virtue among the Akans. Modesty in dress and lifestyle is upheld and there are perpetual reminders of the finitude of life. For instance, the adinkra symbol Owuo Atwedee is one of such reminders. The saying goes that everybody will climb the ladder of death. It is a warning that strong and powerful though one may be, death is inevitable. We have overcome death and all our attempts at inventing potions that will conquer it have failed. There is at least one force—call it nature, call it God, cal it whatever—that operates in the affairs of men and that prevails in the end. To be humble is to order one’s life and arrange one’s affairs with this in mind. It exhibits vertical symmetry because it is actually a picture of two opposing horns. That is the orientation of horns of rams when they fight.
