Funtumfunefu Denkyemfunefu represents two mythical crocodiles (or one, depending on how one looks at it) with one shared stomach. It is a symbol of unity in diversity given a common destiny; sharing. The proverb from which the symbol is derived is “Funtumfunafu Denkyemfunafu, wowo yafunu koro nanso wonya biribi a wofom efiri se aduane no de no yete no wo menetwitwie mu,” to wit, Funtumfunafu and denkyemfunafu share a stomach but when they get something (food) they strive over it because the sweetness of the food is felt as it passes through the throat. This popular symbol is a remind that infighting and tribalism is harmful to all who engage in it.
