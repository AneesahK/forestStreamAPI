Nkyinkyim is an Akan word that literally means “twisting.” It is a symbol for the tortuous nature of life’s journey and, also, the toughness, versatility, and dynamism required to thrive in it. Willis notes that it is also a symbol of dedication to service. Nkyinkyim is an exhortation to persist in the face of difficulties as success in life is not to be taken on a silver platter. The vicissitudes of life should be no excuse to resign to fate. Rather, by mustering the sheer force of will and determination, we can succeed.
